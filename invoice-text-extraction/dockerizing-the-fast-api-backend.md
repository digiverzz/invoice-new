# Dockerizing the Fast-api Backend

To dockerize the FastAPI app for easy deployment and scalability, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile:
   * Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your FastAPI project.
   * Specify the base image for your Docker container. For example, you can use `python:3.7` as the base image.
   * Copy the necessary project files, including `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and any other dependencies, into the Docker image.
   * Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the Docker image.
   * Expose the port that your FastAPI app is running on (e.g., port 8000) using the `EXPOSE` instruction.
2. Build the Docker Image:
   * Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.
   * Build the Docker image by running the following command: `docker build -t fastapi-app .`
   * The `-t` flag is used to specify a tag for the Docker image. In this example, we've used `fastapi-app` as the tag. You can choose a different name as desired.
   * The dot `.` at the end of the command represents the build context, which is the current directory.
3. Run the Docker Container:
   * Once the Docker image is built, you can run it as a container using the following command: `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app`
   * The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.
   * The `-p` flag maps the container's port 8000 to the host's port 5000, enabling access to the FastAPI app from the host machine.
4. Test the Dockerized FastAPI App:
   * Open a web browser or use an API testing tool to access the FastAPI app at `http://localhost:5000` or `http://<your-host-ip>:5000`, depending on your setup.
   * You should be able to send requests to the defined API endpoints and receive responses as expected.

By following these steps, you can package your FastAPI app along with its dependencies into a Docker container, allowing for easy deployment, portability, and scalability across different environments.

Note: Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system before proceeding with these steps.
