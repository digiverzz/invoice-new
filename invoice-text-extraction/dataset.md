# Dataset

Dataset preparation plays a crucial role in training and evaluating the performance of the invoice text extraction solution. A well-prepared dataset ensures that the models, including YOLO, Tesseract, and NLP models, can learn effectively and produce accurate results. Let's explore the key steps involved in dataset preparation:

#### 1. Invoice Image Collection:

The first step is to collect a diverse set of invoice images that represent the variability of invoices in your specific use case. The dataset should include different layouts, fonts, languages, and document quality variations. It's important to ensure that the collected images cover the range of invoice types and categories that you want to extract information from.

#### 2. Annotation and Labeling:

To train the YOLO object detection model, the collected invoice images need to be annotated and labeled. Annotation involves manually marking the regions of interest within the images, such as company names, dates, amounts, and item descriptions. Each annotated region should be associated with the appropriate label or class. There are various annotation tools available that facilitate this process, allowing you to draw bounding boxes around the regions of interest and assign labels.

#### 3. Text Extraction and Labeling:

In addition to annotating the regions of interest, the textual content within those regions needs to be extracted and labeled. This step involves manually transcribing the text within each annotated region. The extracted text should be associated with the corresponding label or class of the region. This labeled text data will be used to train the NLP-based category classification model.

#### 4. Dataset Split:

Once the annotation and labeling process is complete, it's important to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the YOLO object detection model and the NLP-based category classification model. The validation set is utilized for tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the models' performance during training. The testing set is used to assess the models' generalization ability and measure their accuracy on unseen invoice data.

#### 5. Data Augmentation:

To improve the robustness and generalization of the models, data augmentation techniques can be applied to the training dataset. Data augmentation involves applying transformations to the invoice images, such as rotations, flips, scaling, and noise addition. This artificially increases the variability of the training data, helping the models generalize better to unseen invoices with different orientations, sizes, and noise levels.

#### 6. Balancing the Dataset:

It's important to ensure that the dataset is balanced across different invoice categories to prevent bias during training. If certain categories are underrepresented, the models may not learn them effectively. If necessary, you can apply techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset and ensure that each category is adequately represented.

Dataset preparation is a critical step in building an effective invoice text extraction solution. A well-annotated and labeled dataset, along with proper data splitting and augmentation, contributes to the accuracy and generalization ability of the models.
