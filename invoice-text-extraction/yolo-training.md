# YOLO Training

Once the dataset is prepared with annotated invoice images and labeled regions of interest, the next step is to train the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. YOLO is a popular deep learning algorithm known for its real-time object detection capabilities. Here's an overview of the YOLO training process:

#### 1. Dataset Preparation:

Ensure that you have the following components ready for YOLO training:

* Annotated invoice images with labeled regions of interest.
* Corresponding annotation files (e.g., in YOLO format) containing the information about the bounding box coordinates and associated class labels for each region.

#### 2. Configuration:

Set up the YOLO configuration files, which include specifications for the network architecture, hyperparameters, and training parameters. Adjust these configurations based on your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.

#### 3. Pre-trained Model:

Download a pre-trained YOLO model, such as the Darknet YOLO framework. The pre-trained model acts as the starting point for training on your invoice dataset. This model has already learned from a large-scale dataset and can be fine-tuned on your invoice data.

#### 4. Training:

Use the prepared dataset, configuration files, and pre-trained model to initiate the training process. The training involves the following steps:

* Loading the pre-trained YOLO model and the dataset.
* Configuring the training parameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of iterations.
* Iterating over the dataset, feeding the images and corresponding annotation information to the YOLO model.
* Calculating the loss and updating the model's parameters using backpropagation.
* Continuing the training process for multiple epochs until the desired convergence is achieved.

#### 5. Evaluation:

After training, it's crucial to evaluate the trained YOLO model's performance. This evaluation is typically done using a separate validation or testing dataset. It involves running the trained model on the validation/test images, detecting the regions of interest, and comparing the results with the ground truth annotations. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) can be calculated to assess the model's accuracy.
